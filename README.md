# Convertrix

Convertrix - an original converter

Skills: Front-end
Focus: Data manipulation
Difficulty: 2/5

The idea here is not to convert dollars into euros but rather to convert data from one infrequent measurement system to another.

For example: How big is the Eiffel Tower in several automobile? What is the weight of the planet Mars in several printers?

Of course, if the converter is well done, it should allow you to convert actual units and have equally consistent results!
